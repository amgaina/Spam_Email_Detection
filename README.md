# Spam_Email_Detection

This repository contains a simple spam mail detection algorithm using TF-IDF Vectorization and a Machine Learning classifier. The algorithm is designed to classify emails as either spam or ham (not spam) based on their content.

## Introduction

Spam mail detection is an essential task in email management systems to filter out unwanted messages and protect users from potential threats. This project demonstrates how to use TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) Vectorization and a machine learning classifier to build a simple yet effective spam mail detector.

## Features

- Preprocesses email content using TF-IDF Vectorization
- Supports removal of common English stop words
- Converts text to lowercase for uniformity
- Trains a machine learning classifier (Logistic Regression) to detect spam
- Evaluates the model performance using common metrics like accuracy.

## Tools Used

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- numpy
